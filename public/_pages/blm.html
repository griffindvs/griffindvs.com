          <p>"1,011 people have been killed by police in the past year... Although half of the people shot and killed by police are white, black Americans are shot at a disproportionate rate. They account for less than 13 percent of the U.S. population, but are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white Americans."</p>

          <p>"Racist ideas have defined our society since its beginning and can feel so natural and obvious as to be banal.... To be an antiracist is a radical choice in the face of this history, requiring radical reorientation of our consciousness."</p>

          <p>"Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women – and this disparity increases with age, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report..."</p>

          <p>"Black-white disparities exist in virtually all regions and neighborhoods. Some of the <em>best</em> metro areas for economic mobility for low-income black boys are comparable to the <em>worst</em> metro areas for low-income white boys... And black boys have lower rates of upward mobility than white boys in 99 percent of Census tracts in the country."</p>
